## Week 2

### Reflection On Week 2

The presentations on Friday February 1 opened my eyes regarding the possibilities open to me as a software developer.  I was especially inspired by Nickâ€™s presentation on algorithmic and generative art - I changed my individual android project to be one that produces algorithmic art in response to that presentation.  Though I believe this project will be a challenge I also believe it will be within my capabilities to accomplish - this project will push my coding and math skills to a new level.  Nick is definitely throwing a lot of material our way but in a way that seems to follow the idea that I will see the material and practice the material through so many iterations that I will get the material.  Seeing the presentations at the end of the week has helped me keep perspective about the rewards made available by the bootcamp program.


### Visuals Speak

  Recently, before entering a Java Coding bootcamp I was doing well both in my personal life and in my career as a property manager.  I could have ridden out that path to retirement but I wanted something more.  The attached image, [where I am](https://github.com/tnordquist/tnordquist.github.io/blob/master/docs/where-i-am.JPG), of the the bottle of wine, bread, and flower on a table conveys that sort of low key comfort.  But I have long wanted to do something bigger and more consequential involving software development.  The image of being in a major metropolitan area, [Where I Want To Be](https://github.com/tnordquist/tnordquist.github.io/blob/master/docs/where-i-want-to-be.JPG), conveys that notion.  Two or three years from now I will have worked in the tech industry  for some time improving all my programming, math, and soft skills so that I will be ever more attractive to potential employers as a software developer.   In addition I will have produced a passion project or two to improve my capabilities that much more.  Finally, I will work my way toward acquiring a master's degree in computer science as part of that path of bridging that future life with my current life.

### Reflections on Identity Chart
 I'm not sure that a potential recruiter would have found everything I included in the identity chart but he would have found enought to know that I was coming from a solid career foundation.  He would possibly know that I was committed to programming as a hobbyist at least. I believe a recruiter would take a chance with me if he know about my background at UNM and my current enrollement in the bootcamp.  Otherwise, a recruiter might think I did not yet have enough to offer based just off of my online presence.  
 
                               

### Week 1

### Reflection On Week 1 

 I write this first week's journal entry filled with both excitement and some trepidation.

 I feel excitement because this program is obviously preparing me for the technology of the computer programming world, shaping my ability to present myself to employers, and seeing the app contest has already helped to make the developer world I'm entering real. I'm amazed that within four days Nick had the class work on multiple programs which included control loops, arrays, a programming flow chart, comitting and pushing programs from git to github enough times that I've got comitting and pushing down. The programs we worked on were quite a bit more complex by the end of the week than at the beginning of the first day. It's apparent that my programming skills and knowledge will be radically better by the time I've completed the twelve weeks. On the other hand, I have to admit that I feel a bit annoyed about having to work on Dan's preparation work for entering the real programming work world. But, I chose this program exactly because I need the help that Dan is requiring so that I can feel confident about making this huge career shift at this time.

 On another note, I was amazed by the professional way in which the UNM & CNM Mobile app contest teams presented themselves. I felt that, more or less, the apps presented really did provide services that real world people would find useful. Most interesting to me upon learning that a deepdive team won second place was that the deepdive team had 12 weeks of immersive training while the teams from UNM were made up of students who had been in the UNM program for years. The kind of development students undergoe in the boot-camp program is amazing.

 On the other hand, the amount of material and different subjects that we have been required to work through in just the first week of the program makes me feel that I'm just feeling the first gusts of an oncoming hurricane of learning and activites which will push me to the edge emotionally as well as mentally. But the accomplishment of the deepdive team that won second place in the app contest tells me that if I just pace myself and keep calm that I can make it through the program and be ready for success. A bit of a side note, I heard Dan mention the Pomodoro Technique. I started using the Pomodoro a few months ago both for my work and for working on programming at home. I have already been using the Pomodoro Technique to good effect this first week.

## Pitch

 ### V1: Golden Circle

 How: Coding skills What: Scientific data analysis app. Why: to help scientists make sense of their data

 ### V2: Pitch

 Hi my name is Todd. I build custom apps for small scientific companies that help them to realize what business practices are actually potentially profitable. I'm working with Sandia labs as part of a project to help needed scientific industries. If that's something you think you need I'd love to get coffee soon and talk.

### V3: Pitch

 Hi my name is Todd. I build customized applications for small scientific based businesses. I can help your company to transition your discovery from a raw prototype to a marketable product. My app will allow you test your product at various stages of it's development based on a sequenced protocol. I'm in partnership with Sandia Labs which means I have the means to subject your product to scaled testing. Also, my partnership with Sandia Labs helps me to fast track your product to the table of various military and government entities who may be interested acquiring your product. I'd love to schedule a time to sit down and talk if you're interested in what I've presented to you. I'm free most times any day next week.

## Passion Project

 I wanted to acquire a rental property so I would have some economic independence and peace of mind about my future. I researched what kind of property I wanted and where the best locatioin would be. I figured out exactly how much money I needed in order to be qualified to buy the property. The hardest part was finding the right property at the right price. Through lots of negotiating I was able to convince the seller to sell me the property without having to compete against other potential buyers.

## Q & Q

 Quantitative Features about my self:

 Finished 12/13 chapter programming exercise challenges fro Eck' Programming book.

 Took 4 CS classes at UNM.

 Spent 6 years as a property manager.

 Qualitative Features about my self:

 Perfectionist: It can be a weakness by stopping me from finishing a job, project, etc. but it also helps me to do quality work.

 Dedicated: This quality can be a weakness because it can cause me to stay with something when that something may not be good for me. This trait could be a strength by giving me the power to stick with something that would be beneficial in the long run. It is also a strength because it shows people who work with me and for whom I work that I can be relied upon.

 Idealist: This trait can be a weakness because it can lead me to get involved in ventures which really don't have any hope of succeeding in the real world. This trait can be a strength because it allows me to attempt projects and other endeavors that go beyond the humdrum usual jobs and projects.
