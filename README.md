## Visuals Speak

  Recently, before entering a Java Coding bootcamp I was doing well both in my personal life and in my career as a property manager.  I could have ridden out that path to retirement but I wanted something more.  The attached image of the the bottle of wine, bread, and flower on a table conveys that sort of low key comfort.  But I have long wanted to do something bigger and more consequential involving software development.  The image of being in a major metropolitan area conveys that notion.  Two or three years from now I will have worked in the tech industry  for some time improving all my programming, math, and soft skills so that I will be ever more attractive to potential employers as a software developer.   In addition I will have produced a passion project or two to improve my capabilities that much more.  Finally, I will work my way toward acquiring a master's degree in computer science as part of that path of bridging that future life with my current life.
