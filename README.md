## Week 12

### Reflection On Week 11

I'm feeling a lot of pressure going into the last week having only 1 1/2 weeks to do an entire capstone project.  The project does seem to be coming together though despite the time constraint.  Now the thoughts of applying for jobs and presenting the capstone at demo day is growing very strong.

## Week 9

### Reflection On Week 9

I felt relieved on Friday because I finished the last of the functional aspects needed to get my individual Android app working properly.  My goal was then to finish all the documentation and so be done with the app by Monday March 25.  That did not happen.  I hope to be done with the app by Tuesday so that I could start focusing on the capstone project - we're having a hard time finding a working star map api.

## Week 8

### Reflection On Week 8

I was glad to hear that there are efforts to lay fiber optics cable across the state in the attempt to upgrade the internet.  I thought the work being done by optiplus to be especially promising.  Regarding the rest of the week I did well on the second exam, which allows me to better concentrate on the big Android projects.  I made some breakthroughs in my Android work in the last few days after struggling for some time.

## Week 7

### Reflection On Week 7
The huge amount of work I have to do in a short period of time is really hitting me now.  I'm working on two android projects at the same time while needing to also practice coding and still learn new things.  At the same time there's the looming thought that soon this will be over and I'll be scrambling to land a job.  This is all very intense but I'm feeling good about it.

## Week 6

### Reflection On Week 6

It's half way through the program and the majority of the work still has to be done - that's kind of scary.  But, we clearly will have lots of time to work on our projects while in class with Nick nearby to help - so not so scary.  The tour of the server facility on Friday helped me to further get a feel for the fact that there really is a lot of work opportunity out there - all of the presenters did work that interested me.  When Dan announced he sent my comments out to RS21 it hit me that I need to greatly improve my LinkeIn site.

## Week 5

### Reflection On Week 5

I'm very glad that Ingenuity Software Lab crew came in to speak.  I feel confident that John and Lisa would genuinely be glad to help connect me to prospective employers if I reached out to them (which I will).  I've recovered from the first major exam and am preparing for the much more intense project work to come.

### One Million Cups
I spoke with Randy Crawl and spoke with him about data analysis and what is required to be a data scientist.

## Week 4

### Reflection On Week 4

I did not breeze through the practical exam 1 this Friday as I had thought I would.  I got the actual basic programs correct but then got hung up on small code errors that prevented the program from producing all the correct results.  I learned that I need to practice code challenges more and that I especially need to become more habituated to debugging.  If I had been able to more calmly go through the debugging process I would have solved enough problem questions to have more than the full points needed for the practical exam.

### Capstone Project Rules of Engagement: Celestial Bodies

#### Rules of Engagement
- All team members are personally committed to achieving the goals of the team for completing the capstone project.
- Team members have courage to do the right thing and work on tough problems.
- Everyone focuses on the work of the goals of the Team.
- The Team agrees to be open about all the work and the challenges with performing the work.
- Team members respect each other to be capable, independent people.

We will schedule our first meet up this week.

### Relection on Playing Forbidden Island
I was surprised and happy about how well my capstone team members and I worked together to understand the game and then play and win.  I initially underestimated both my team members - they got the hang of the game faster than I did. I had more confidence in our ability to make the capstone project work even before the game was over. 

## Week 3

### Reflection On Week 3

The end of the week presentations were as helpful as the presentations from last week. This time a human face was put on prospective employers and fellow employees. I was especially encouraged by the outlook of Michael Herrick regarding hiring new employees - he cares that a person has done the hard work of learning how to think (algorithmic thinking) rather than how much surface show they have.  I hope there are a lot more prospective employers like him out there.  In any case, his presentation helped me reconfirm in my own mind that if I keep working on the ability to tackle problems and solve them my new career path looks bright.  And yes I know that I need to put a lot of work into hunting down those opportunities as well.
### Stove Top Activity

- Finish CS courses needed to enter the CS Master's program at UNM.
- Become expert in data structures.
- Set up coffee date with friend I know who works at a company that I want to apply to.
- Get hired at a company that creates computer modeling of physical processes.

### Identify Two Orgs

#### For Profit Organization
- ##### Deacon Property Services
- Kyle Deacon
- kdeacon24@swcp.com, [Deacon Property Services](http://deaconpropertyservices.com)
- I selected this company because I know the owner wants to update the website.  I used to work at this company and I made the website about five years ago - it needs updating both front end and back end.
- I know this person so I just need to schedule dinner with him.

#### Not-For-Profit Organization
- ##### Sandia Foundation
- Mark Benak, appears to be on the board, but he has his own tech. company that builds new businesses, which has sparked my curiosity.
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mbenak/)  [twitter](https://twitter.com/mbenak) [uptake](https://www.uptake.com)
- I selected this company because it appears that the founders have a long history in Albuquerque of helping promising students pay for college and of helping people, especially it appears, who want to start technology companies.  All that appeals to me and seems like a worthwhile road to go down.  The foundation's website is clunky and hard to navigate.  I suspect they would not mind some help if presented in the right way.
- I will begin the process of reaching out th Mark by filling out the form on his website, by tweeting him, and through his linkedIn page.

### Salary Expectations and Potential

I have hope to begin at the $60,000ish range salary.  Regarding programming capability, in addition to soon having this bootcamp under my belt, a few years ago at UNM I took two java courses as well as Linear Algebra and Discrete Mathematics.  I think my math background should improve my ability to get a job at a place like Sandia Labs.  Also, I solved the exercise challenges, so far, in 12 of 13 chaptersI'm hoping to leverage my work experience in other fields, especially my experience with having to talk with a lot of people, to make myself stand out as a good risk for an employer to take on.

## Week 2

### Reflection On Week 2

The presentations on Friday February 1 opened my eyes regarding the possibilities open to me as a software developer.  I was especially inspired by Nickâ€™s presentation on algorithmic and generative art - I changed my individual android project to be one that produces algorithmic art in response to that presentation.  Though I believe this project will be a challenge I also believe it will be within my capabilities to accomplish - this project will push my coding and math skills to a new level.  Nick is definitely throwing a lot of material our way but in a way that seems to follow the idea that I will see the material and practice the material through so many iterations that I will get the material.  Seeing the presentations at the end of the week has helped me keep perspective about the rewards made available by the bootcamp program.


### Visuals Speak

  Recently, before entering a Java Coding bootcamp I was doing well both in my personal life and in my career as a property manager.  I could have ridden out that path to retirement but I wanted something more.  The attached image, [where I am](https://github.com/tnordquist/tnordquist.github.io/blob/master/docs/where-i-am.JPG), of the the bottle of wine, bread, and flower on a table conveys that sort of low key comfort.  But I have long wanted to do something bigger and more consequential involving software development.  The image of being in a major metropolitan area, [where I want to be](https://github.com/tnordquist/tnordquist.github.io/blob/master/docs/where-i-want-to-be.JPG), conveys that notion.  Two or three years from now I will have worked in the tech industry  for some time improving all my programming, math, and soft skills so that I will be ever more attractive to potential employers as a software developer.   In addition I will have produced a passion project or two to improve my capabilities that much more.  Finally, I will work my way toward acquiring a master's degree in computer science as part of that path of bridging that future life with my current life.

### Reflections on Identity Chart
 I'm not sure that a potential recruiter would have found everything I included in the identity chart but he would have found enought to know that I was coming from a solid career foundation.  He would possibly know that I was committed to programming as a hobbyist at least. I believe a recruiter would take a chance with me if he know about my background at UNM and my current enrollement in the bootcamp.  Otherwise, a recruiter might think I did not yet have enough to offer based just off of my online presence.  
 
                               

### Week 1

### Reflection On Week 1 

 I write this first week's journal entry filled with both excitement and some trepidation.

 I feel excitement because this program is obviously preparing me for the technology of the computer programming world, shaping my ability to present myself to employers, and seeing the app contest has already helped to make the developer world I'm entering real. I'm amazed that within four days Nick had the class work on multiple programs which included control loops, arrays, a programming flow chart, comitting and pushing programs from git to github enough times that I've got comitting and pushing down. The programs we worked on were quite a bit more complex by the end of the week than at the beginning of the first day. It's apparent that my programming skills and knowledge will be radically better by the time I've completed the twelve weeks. On the other hand, I have to admit that I feel a bit annoyed about having to work on Dan's preparation work for entering the real programming work world. But, I chose this program exactly because I need the help that Dan is requiring so that I can feel confident about making this huge career shift at this time.

 On another note, I was amazed by the professional way in which the UNM & CNM Mobile app contest teams presented themselves. I felt that, more or less, the apps presented really did provide services that real world people would find useful. Most interesting to me upon learning that a deepdive team won second place was that the deepdive team had 12 weeks of immersive training while the teams from UNM were made up of students who had been in the UNM program for years. The kind of development students undergoe in the boot-camp program is amazing.

 On the other hand, the amount of material and different subjects that we have been required to work through in just the first week of the program makes me feel that I'm just feeling the first gusts of an oncoming hurricane of learning and activites which will push me to the edge emotionally as well as mentally. But the accomplishment of the deepdive team that won second place in the app contest tells me that if I just pace myself and keep calm that I can make it through the program and be ready for success. A bit of a side note, I heard Dan mention the Pomodoro Technique. I started using the Pomodoro a few months ago both for my work and for working on programming at home. I have already been using the Pomodoro Technique to good effect this first week.

## Pitch

 How: Coding skills What: Scientific data analysis app. Why: to help scientists make sense of their data

 ### V2: Pitch

 Hi my name is Todd. I build custom apps for small scientific companies that help them to realize what business practices are actually potentially profitable. I'm working with Sandia labs as part of a project to help needed scientific industries. If that's something you think you need I'd love to get coffee soon and talk.

### V3: Pitch

 Hi my name is Todd. I build customized applications for small scientific based businesses. I can help your company to transition your discovery from a raw prototype to a marketable product. My app will allow you test your product at various stages of it's development based on a sequenced protocol. I'm in partnership with Sandia Labs which means I have the means to subject your product to scaled testing. Also, my partnership with Sandia Labs helps me to fast track your product to the table of various military and government entities who may be interested acquiring your product. I'd love to schedule a time to sit down and talk if you're interested in what I've presented to you. I'm free most times any day next week.

## Passion Project

 I wanted to acquire a rental property so I would have some economic independence and peace of mind about my future. I researched what kind of property I wanted and where the best locatioin would be. I figured out exactly how much money I needed in order to be qualified to buy the property. The hardest part was finding the right property at the right price. Through lots of negotiating I was able to convince the seller to sell me the property without having to compete against other potential buyers.

## Q & Q

 Quantitative Features about my self:

 Finished 12/13 chapter programming exercise challenges fro Eck' Programming book.

 Took 4 CS classes at UNM.

 Spent 6 years as a property manager.

 Qualitative Features about my self:

 Perfectionist: It can be a weakness by stopping me from finishing a job, project, etc. but it also helps me to do quality work.

 Dedicated: This quality can be a weakness because it can cause me to stay with something when that something may not be good for me. This trait could be a strength by giving me the power to stick with something that would be beneficial in the long run. It is also a strength because it shows people who work with me and for whom I work that I can be relied upon.

 Idealist: This trait can be a weakness because it can lead me to get involved in ventures which really don't have any hope of succeeding in the real world. This trait can be a strength because it allows me to attempt projects and other endeavors that go beyond the humdrum usual jobs and projects.
